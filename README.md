# Outlier-Detection-and-Removal-from-Multimedia
Detection and removal of specific types of outliers present in different data formats, including contextual outliers from textual data using LOF, outliers from tabular numeric data using LOF, Gaussian noise from image data using NLM, and Gaussian noisy image frames from video data using autoencoder. 

## Procedure
1. Textual Data: Synthetic textual data on a prompt is generated and contaminated by 40% outliers(non-contextual data). LOF is used to detect and remove outlier sentences in anomalous synthetic data.
